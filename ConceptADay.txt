What type of HTTP request is login and logout?
with login we are not creating a new resource, not updating or deleting any of that.
None of the CRUD operations.

The way we address this is as a request or command
we create a new login request/command
/api/logins

maybe store all the logins of applications in a separate collection in mongodb. 
treating it as login resource and use post to create it.
